# LogoPCB

This project is about a patch antenna for the 23cm Ham Radio Band (L band) with one peculiatiry: it exhibits the logo of our student asociation Radio Club E.I.T.!

- **Directivity:** 6.25dBi
- **Impedance:** 50Ohm
- **Board dimmensions:** 110x110 mm
- **Minimum VSWR:** 1.13 @ 1297MHz
- **Max. power:** 50W

## Used tools

After the electromagnetic simulation, it was necessary to create the files needed to fabricate the PCBs (gerbers) and finding some way to inspect them before production. For that purpose, the [EasyEDA](http://www.EasyEDA.com) website ended up being a complete and easy to use alternative to common bulky softwares!

## PCB fabrication and measurements.

We have already ordered some PCB boards of this design to [JLCPCB](http://www.jlcpcb.com) in order to test them and measure them! The offer great service at incredibly low costs. 

Stay tuned to this repo for further updates!

_Added:_ This repository will participate in the JLCPCB design contest 2020!
